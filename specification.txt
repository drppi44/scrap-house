Required DB: MySQL with simplest config as possible (total of 3 tables, one for each site) With fast and efficient framework to apply following steps:
- The scrape of each site will be separate, and each script can be run at any time (on our side we will set a scheduler to run them)
- Firstable to do a validation to check if the scraping is possible (in case changes on the site were done)
will be tried to check some basic details, if it fails then return error (not loading any image for best performance)
- Scrape the entire list of Listings with its ID and its update/creation date (not loading any image for best performance)
- Compare that list with the one already existing on the DB.
+ If is same ID with greater date, then needs to be updated
+ If ID is not in DB, needs to be created
+ If ID exists and the update/creation date is less than the last date of run, then ignore - For all the Listings that need to be created or updated:
- Scrape all its details and update or create it on the DB.
If Update case, not loading any image for best performance

1) To scrape through all locations...
(for example with Residential-Rent case)
https://www.idealista.com/alquiler-viviendas/[location]-provincia/
needs to be replaced [location] by each of the options available in the  <ul id="location-combo" class="homecombo" name="locationId" size="8">  from the 3rd "li" element
[location] to be always lower case and replacing spaces with _ (for example, "Santa Cruz de Tenerife" will be "santa-cruz-de-tenerife")


2) Basic rows table structure:
 - Listing ID
 - Listing Update/Creation Date
 - Type: Residential, Commercial
 - Sub-Type:
  + for Residential: Apartment, House, Duplex
  + for Commercial: Office, Retail, Warehouse
 - Operation: Buy, Rent, Share


3) Combination of main selections needed to scrape:
* Residential:
 - Comprar + Vivienda - venta-viviendas/
 - Alquilar + Vivienda - alquiler-viviendas/

* Share:
 - Compartir + Vivienda - alquiler-habitacion/

* Office:
 - Comprar + Oficinas - venta-oficinas/
 - Alquilar + Oficinas - alquiler-oficinas/

* Retail and/or Warehouse:
 - Comprar + Locales o naves - venta-locales/
 - Aluilar + Locales o naves - alquiler-locales/


4) GENERAL PREREQUISITES:
 - Firstable to do a validation to check if the scraping is done correctly (in case changes on the site were done)
  will be tried to check a specific Listing with expected details to compare if there are the same (not loading any image for best performance)

 - Scrape the entire list of Listings with its ID and its update/creation date (not loading any image for best performance)
   For example for the case of Residential-Rent for the location of Madrid:  https://www.idealista.com/alquiler-viviendas/madrid-provincia/

   NOTE: To check the update/creation date of Listings is hidden somewhere in this page? (we need to avoid to load each Listing details to know this, otherwise it will greatly hit performance)
         Other option might be to force the site filter of "Fecha de publicación" to be on the time range since the last scrape


 -  Compare that list with all Listing IDs with the IDs already existing on the DB.
  + If is same ID with greater date, then needs to be updated
  + If ID is not in DB, needs to be created
  + If ID exists and the update/cration date is less than the last date of run, then ignore

 - For all the Listings that need to be created or updated:
  - Scrape all its details and update or create it on the DB.
    If Update case, not loading any image for best performance
